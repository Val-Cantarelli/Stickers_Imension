# Alura Immersion - Java Sticker Generator

## Overview
During the **Alura Java Immersion**, the goal was to create an application that generates stickers for WhatsApp. This project involved consuming the IMDb API to get movie information and generating custom stickers based on that data. The course provided an opportunity to dive into practical Java development while solving real-world challenges.

## Technologies Used
- **Java 17**: Primary programming language for building the application.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework used to build the RESTful API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store data.
- **Heroku**:(Heroku discontinued its free tier) Platform for deploying the application to the cloud.
- **Git**: Version control for the project code.

## Key Challenges
1. **Consuming the IMDb API**: Using the IMDb API's endpoint to fetch popular movie data in real-time.
2. **Generating Custom Stickers**: Using Java libraries to create images containing movie information like title, release year, and rating.
3. **Personalizing Stickers**: Adding elements such as emojis, stylized fonts, and text borders to make the stickers more engaging.
4. **Refactoring and Object-Oriented Programming**: Applying OOP concepts to enhance the code structure and readability.
5. **Creating a RESTful API**: Building a Spring Boot API to expose the movie data and allow interaction with the app.
6. **Cloud Deployment**: Deploying the application to Heroku to make it publicly accessible.
